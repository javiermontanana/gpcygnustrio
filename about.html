          <img alt="Trio photo" class="bio-image" src="/img/bio-image.jpg" />The Cygnus Trio illustrates the capacity of music and musicianship to transcend physical and geographical boundaries, with twin homes in Valencia and London.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Valencia, Javier Monta&ntilde;ana and C&eacute;sar Saura initially studied together and formed a duo, before enrolling at the Royal Academy of Music (London), where they respectively studied violin with Richard Deakin, and piano with Daniel Ben-Pienaar and William Fong. In London, Hannah Lewis won a scholarship to continue her cello studies with David Smith at the Royal Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2012, across both Valencia and London, the three formed the Cygnus Piano Trio and have been playing and travelling together ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a group, they receive regular coaching from Richard Deakin, Michael Dussek and Nicholas Roberts, as well as having taken part in numerous masterclasses with ensembles such as the Doric Quartet and Trio Owon. They have also studied with renowned chamber musicians including Jeremy Young and William Coleman (Kuss Quartet). As members of the Piano Trio Society they have had the opportunity to participate in masterclasses with guest tutors including Raphael Wallfisch and Krzystof Smietana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past year, they have been awarded prizes in a number of competitions, such as the &lsquo;Ant&oacute;n Garc&iacute;a Abril&rsquo; International Chamber Music Competition and the &lsquo;Ecoparque de Trasmiera&rsquo;, amongst others. This success has allowed them to build up regular concert engagements in Spain and the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years they have been invited to partake in events such as the Santander International Music Festival (Spain), the Toledo Chamber Music Festival (Spain), Music Coll (Scotland) and the Wye Valley Chamber Music Festival (Wales). The three also enjoy participating in cultural activities of contrasting backgrounds which has led to engagements ranging from a fundraising concert for the Homerton Hospital in London to the opening of an art exhibition in Villarreal (Spain).</p>
